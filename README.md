Online content’s continuous growth has led creators and platforms to question how to predict a post’s popularity. A 2010 research paper by Szabo and Huberman investigated the topic of predicting online content trends, noting a strong connection between early views and long-term popularity, with accuracy duration varying by platform. This study aims to predict YouTube video popularity, focusing on videos published in the genres ’Entertainment’ and ’News & Politics’. Utilizing YouTube’s API for data and employing an adjusted Random Forest Regression model, findings showed that using the initial 72-hour data, it is possible to predict a video’s 7-day view count with a relatively low error margin of around 12%. The work was also able to examine differences in the development of video view numbers between YouTube categories. The predictability of video views varies between ’Entertainment’ and ’News & Politics’ genres. While both peak within 24 hours of release, ’News & Politics’ videos achieve a significantly higher view rate, and the subsequent view rate for both categories similarly declines without narrowing the gap.
